			In compliance with <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules_en">the EU General
			Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, we are required to provide
			you with the following information regarding what data we gather, and
			why we gather it.
			</p>
			<p>
			The data controller in the case of this community is the Aurorastation host,
			Arrow768. All queries, complaints, and requests regarding GDPR and the data
			processing done by the community staff can be filed to <a href="mailto:gdpr@aurorastation.org">
			gdpr@aurorastation.org</a>. The data controller is responsible for providing
			a gaming service along with supported services (chat room/forums).
			All of the data listed below is stored and processed both automatically and
			manually. In the case of manual processing, only members of the Aurorastation
			staff have access to the data.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Notice regarding right to erasure.</b> Under GDPR we are obligated to keep
			certain data on legal grounds. Specifically connection and registration logs,
			so we could demonstrate positive consent retroactively, and data surrounding
			bans. <b>This means that exercising right to erasure does not mean you get
			unbanned.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
			The following sections will describe, in detail, what data we store, which
			service the data relates to.
			</p>

			<h3>The Game</h3>
			<p>By visiting the game server, you consent under article 6(1) point f
			of GDPR to provide us with the following information for storage and later
			processing. All of the following information is gathered with the purpose
			<b>of allowing you to store persistent information required for game functions</b>
			(character saves, preferences), <b>and for allowing us to enforce our server
			rules.</b> The ability to enforce community rules is a legitimate interest
			that Aurorastation has, and what enables us to provide the service to an
			acceptable standard.</p>
			<p>The stored information, from the game server, is:
				<ul>
					<li><b>IP address</b>
					<p>An IP address is logged every time you connect to our server.
						Thi IP address is used as a component to positively identify
						you as the player you claim to be. And is linked to certain data sets,
						primarily connection information and administration logs.
					</p></li>
					<li><b>Ckey</b>
					<p>The BYOND ckey (username), considered a unique identifier,
						is logged every time you connect, and is tied to all persistent
						data kept regarding your activities in the game. This includes, but
						is not limited to: punitive data, logs, in-game character information,
						in-game preferences.
					</p></li>
					<li><b>Computer identifier</b>
					<p>The computer identifier is a mostly-unique string of characters generated
						by BYOND. It is used, alongside the IP address and ckey, to identify
						you as the player you claim to be. And is linked to certain data sets,
						primarily connection information and administration logs.
					</p></li>
					<li><b>Game, connection, and administrative logs</b>
					<p>As you play on the server, all actions you undertake in interacting
						with the server are subject to automatic logging. These logs are retained
						primarily for administrative purposes, which includes but is not limited
						to: enforcing community rules, evaluating player and staff actions
						upon valid request (appeals, complaints, etcetera).
					</p></li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h3>The Forums</h3>
			<p>By registering on the forums of Aurorastation, you explicitly agree to provide
				us with the information required for registration (you are prompted to agree
				with providing us with this information upon registration) and further agree
				that we log your IP address as a way of identifying you as the user in question.
				All of the following data is stored with your explicit permission, and will be
				used by us to <b>enforce our community rules.</b></p>
			<p>The stored information, from the forums, is:
				<ul>
					<li><b>Username</b>
					<p>The username is required as a way for us to identify you within our system.
						This username is tied to all posts you make and all logs that you generate.
					</p></li>
					<li><b>IP address</b>
					<p>For major action, specifically registration and posting, an IP address
						is stored and tied to that action. This data is stored for administrative
						purposes, which includes, but is not limited to: enforcing community rules,
						evaluating player and staff actions upon valid request (appeals,
						complaints, etcetera).
					</p></li>
					<li><b>Email address</b>
					<p>An email address is stored for administrative purposes. This address
						is used both for automated actions, such as verifying you for account
						recovery; as well as for manual actions, for example, should we need to
						inform all registered users with something.
					</p></li>
					<li><b>All communications made by you</b>
					<p>All communication you make using the forums, including but not limited to
						forum posts, private messages, are stored and linked with your username
						and IP address. This is a necessary mechanic for the forums to function.
					</p>
					<p><b>Notice regarding private messages:</b> private messages are kept in the
					database in a human readable fashion. However, at present, only the server
					host has access to these. And there are no circumstances, outside of legal
					matters, wherein we would look at them.
					</p></li>
